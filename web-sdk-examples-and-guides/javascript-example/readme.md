# Identity Solution Web SDK Example

This example code can be run by placing the SDK folders in the indicated locations, and then double-clicking on index-simple-demo.html to launch it using Chrome.

Note that in order to run the index-simple-demo.html code there are four pre-requisites:

1. Set up a GBG Identity Solution account by contacting GBG
2. Set up Delegated Authentication with an identity provider such as Microsoft, or alternatively request a Pre-generated token from GBG
3. Place the Web SDK (obtained from GBG) in the indicated locations
4. Edit the html file and either implement your chosen authentication method using an authentication library (such as Active Directory Authentication Library ADAL or a HTTP library such as Fetch API) or alternatively copy-and-paste an IDP Access Token from (say) Postman if you're using that for experimenting with HTTP requests, into the getAccessToken function.

Use the Chrome Developer tools in order to examine the operation of the code.
